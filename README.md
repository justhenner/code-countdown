## Description

"Code Countdown: Get Your Yoga On" tests users on their knowledge of yoga asanas, referred to as poses in the west, through a four question timed quiz. If the user answers correctly they will be rewarded with a "Eureka!", but if they don't they'll get a big "Womp!" instead coupled with a timed deduction from the timer that is already ticking. Once all questions have been answered users can choose to save their highscore, play again, and/or simply say nahhhh(maste) to clear the board.

## Code Snippet

### countDown() 
As if answering taking a quiz wasn't reason to be nervous already, the countDown() function below sets up a timer using the setInterval() method in JavaScript to make users perspire just a little more as they ponder away.

### answerKey
Grading made easy. The answerKey variable, an array of objects, below representing a question and its answer is used to display the quiz questions and answer options on a webpage. It goes on to check the user's responses against the correct answers to calculate a score.
